## Space pirate: Going Deeper

This pwn task was really interesting, because many struggled with this containing me for 2-3 days to understand it. And the trick was simple but elegant :D 
So first of all we are downloading the task files, which contain sp_going_deeper ELF x86_64 executable, glibc library for the executable to load some external functions and flag.txt (HTB{f4k3_fl4g_4_t35t1ng}).  

First we are going to connect to the remote host to understand what suprises wait for us. 
```
$ nc <ip> <port>
$ telnet <ip> <port>
```
After connecting we can see this banner :O

In the banner there is an interesting monitor/laptop in which it is said there is a "goldenfang" user which changed secret_pass.txt name to flag.txt. 
And we got 3 options.
1. Disable mechanisms 
2. Login
3. Exit 

We totally don't want to exit, so we will go ahread with the first two.

First option gives us "Input" prompt, and the second option gives us "Login" prompt, as the answer for all the inputs there was "Authentication failed!" output and connection was terminated.

So to understand the executable more deeper, we should analyze it and see what is contains. 
We can use **strings** command to see human readable strings in the executable.
```
$ strings <filename>
```
For out file:

We see that the command outputs really interesting and valuable information from the executable.

We can see some string, which (we hope) is not misleading.
